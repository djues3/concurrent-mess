# Welcome to Concurrent Mess
This is a 1BRC inspired homework assignment for the "Concurrent and Distributed Programming" course.

There are many crimes against programming in this repository, I sincerely apologize.

## How to run
This project requires the newest version of the JDK to run (at time of release, JDK 24). It also uses preview features.
```bash
./gradlew run
```

Do note:
- The actual app is located in the /app directory. All paths are relative to that.
- This means that the directory being watched is ./app/watch 
- The config can be changed in the /app/src/main/resources/config.toml file.
